# Your data

Your data should be yours. MQTTitude does all it can to ensure that,
and you decide where you store your data, how to process it, and for
how long you store it (if at all).

However, be advised, that if you're very concerned about privacy,
you probably shouldn't be using a smartphone at all. MQTTitude uses
your smartphone's location services to determine where it is. While
you decide whether you want to enable or disable this feature (check
your phone's documentation), there is no guarantee that the APIs used
by MQTTitude won't submit your data to the vendor's servers.

For example, it's quite possible that Apple or Google keep requests
used for reverse geo-coding your location; there is pretty much
nothing MQTTitude can do to avoid this.

It's your choice.
