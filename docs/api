## API

The MQTTitude backend is designed to store locations that are provided by mobile apps into a database. 
It provides a REST API that can be accessed to view and manage stored locations. 

The backend does not protect your data in transit. 
It is therefore strongly advised to issue all API calls over a secure connection to the server. 

This document assumes that the MQTTitude backend is running on ```localhost```.
